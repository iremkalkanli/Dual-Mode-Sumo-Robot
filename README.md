# Dual-Mode Sumo Robot

It is a sumo robot with two modes. </br>
While being able to remove 5 obstacles for 60 seconds is one mode, the other mode is to follow the line.
## Results

Data were processed through the sensors in the robot set and appropriate algorithms were developed. </br>
Ideas were made about the operations that may be required for operations such as line tracking and removing obstacles. </br>
Thanks to this application, it has been learned in which areas microcontrollers can be used.
